# 🎄 GDG Córdoba Advent Challenges: ¡Let's code! 🎄

## About the Project

Welcome to the **GDG Córdoba Advent Challenges** repository!

This is where the Google Developers Group (GDG) of Córdoba, Spain, is hosting a series of festive programming challenges to celebrate the holiday season, inspired by the traditional Advent of Code.

Forget cold snow and generic puzzles—get ready for a unique flavor! Unlike the standard Advent of Code, **all our challenges are themed around the rich culture, history, gastronomy, and quirks of Córdoba, Andalusia.** Expect problems involving _salmorejo_, _patios_, _flamenco_, or the Roman bridge!

## 🗓️ Challenge Schedule

Challenges will **not** be released daily. We're keeping it relaxed, _a la cordobesa_.

A new challenge will be published **once per week** on the following dates:

|      Challenge       | Release Date  | Theme Hint                                             |
| :------------------: | :-----------: | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Week 1 Challenge** | 5th December  | _Roman Bridge Stability_                               |
| **Week 2 Challenge** | 12nd December | _Christmas market in the site of the Mosque-Cathedral_ |
| **Week 3 Challenge** |      ...      | TBA                                                    |
| **Week 4 Challenge** |      ...      | TBA                                                    |
